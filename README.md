# üöÄ Project 1: Automated Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins and Docker

## Objective
Implement an automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible.

## Description
This project aims to develop a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, testing, and deployment of a sample application. We utilize Jenkins for continuous integration, Docker for containerization, and Ansible for configuration management. The pipeline includes automated testing and deployment to a cloud environment.

### Forked Repository
This project is based on the web application forked from [DevOps Challenge](https://github.com/tradebyte/DevOps-Challenge.git).

## Tasks and Subprojects

### Task 1: Environment Setup
**Description:** 
- Set up Jenkins and Docker on local or cloud environments to create a foundational base for the CI/CD pipeline.
- Develop a simple application (e.g., a web app) and Dockerize it to prepare for the build and deployment stages.
- Install Ansible for configuration management.


### Task 2: CI Integration with Jenkins
**Description:**
- Create Jenkins Jobs to automate the build process for the Dockerized application.
- Integrate a GitHub or GitLab repository for continuous integration.
- Incorporate automated testing (e.g., unit tests) into the Jenkins pipeline.
- Set up notifications for pipeline success or failure to keep stakeholders informed.


### Task 3: Docker Deployment
**Description:**
- Push Docker images to Docker Hub or a private registry to make them accessible for deployment.
- Write Ansible playbooks to automate the deployment of the application to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP).
- Test the deployment process with Docker and Ansible to ensure a smooth workflow.


### Task 4: CI/CD Refinement & Final Testing
**Description:**
- Optionally configure Kubernetes to manage the deployment of Docker containers.
- Refine Jenkins jobs for efficiency by implementing parallel stages and caching.
- Conduct comprehensive tests of the CI/CD pipeline from code commit to deployment.
- Complete documentation of the project, covering pipeline design, deployment processes, and any challenges faced.
